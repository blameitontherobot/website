        <p><img src="assets/pointer.gif" alt="pointer" width="40" height="40" />&nbsp;I'm primarily a music composer, but I can do 3D models and make my own graphics. These pointers here were made by me!</p>
        <p><img src="assets/pointer.gif" alt="pointer" width="40" height="40" /> I really, really like Japanese PS1 games and their aesthetic.</p>
        <p><img src="assets/pointer.gif" alt="pointer" width="40" height="40" />&nbsp;I'm a big When They Cry and Suda51 fan. Probably his favourite game for me is Moonlight Syndrome.</p>
