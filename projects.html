        <p>• UNC (Unreleased Nintendo Collective) is a major project focused on making<br>believable, high-quality "what-if" videos based on Nintendo games.<br>
            For example, what if Wario Land 3 was a scrapped N64 game? We aim to make<br>more of these videos soon, so make sure to watch Marionova's channel.</p>
        <p>I also made songs on the soundtrack for this!! You can find a soundtrack release <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsqIa4WaMQk&t=3s">here.</a></p>

        <p>• Pizza Delivery 2 is a game made by fans, for fans. It's a satire on many things,<br>like adult TV shows, action films, puzzle games, Petscop...<br>
        It's being made by a team of talented individuals (and me for some reason), all who can<br>be found on Twitter under the LOVE PIZZA INC. grouping.</p>
